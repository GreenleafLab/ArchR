\arguments{
\item{ArchRProj}{An \code{ArchRProject} object.}

\item{groupBy}{The name of the column in \code{cellColData} to use for grouping cells together for marker feature identification.}

\item{useGroups}{A character vector that is used to select a subset of groups by name from the designated \code{groupBy} column in \code{cellColData}. This limits the groups used to perform marker feature identification.}

\item{bgdGroups}{A character vector that is used to select a subset of groups by name from the designated \code{groupBy} column in \code{cellColData} to be used for background calculations in marker feature identification.}

\item{useMatrix}{The name of the matrix to be used for performing differential analyses. Options include "GeneScoreMatrix", "PeakMatrix", etc.}

\item{bias}{A character vector indicating the potential bias variables as a function (i.e. c("TSSEnrichment", "log10(nFrags)")) to account for in selecting a matched null group for marker feature identification. These should be column names from \code{cellColData}.}

\item{normBy}{The name of a numeric column in \code{cellColData} that should be normalized across cells (i.e. "ReadsInTSS") prior to performing marker feature identification.}

\item{testMethod}{The name of the pairwise test method to use in comparing cell groupings to the null cell grouping during marker feature identification. Valid options include "wilcoxon", "ttest", and "binomial".}

\item{maxCells}{The maximum number of cells to consider from a single cell group when performing marker feature identification.}

\item{scaleTo}{Normalization depth to center normalization to in normBy (default is 10,000).}

\item{threads}{The number of threads to be used for parallel computing.}

\item{k}{The number of nearby cells to use for selecting biased-matched background while accounting for bgdGroups proportions.}

\item{bufferRatio}{The buffering ratio of cells to enable best biased-matched background while accounting for bgdGroups proportions.}

\item{binarize}{A boolean value indicating whether to binarize the matrix prior to differential testing.}

\item{useSeqnames}{A character vector that indicates which seqnames should be used in marker feature identification. Features from seqnames that are not listed will be ignored.}

\item{method}{The name of the method to be used for marker feature identification. Valid options are "ArchR" which will use the default ArchR method or "Venice" which will use the \code{Signac::VeniceMarker()} fucntion.}

\item{verboseHeader}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose sections.}

\item{verboseAll}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose subsections.}

\item{...}{additional args}
}
