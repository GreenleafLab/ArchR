\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the x-axis values for each point.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector containing the y-axis values for each point.}

\item{color}{A numeric/categorical vector containing coloring information for each point.}

\item{pal}{A custom continuous palette from \code{ArchRPalettes} for coloration of hexes.}

\item{bins}{The number of bins to be used for plotting the hexplot. \code{bins} indicates the total number of hexagons that will fit within the surface area of the plot.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of two values indicating the lower and upper bounds of the x-axis on the plot.}

\item{ylim}{A numeric vector of two values indicating the lower and upper bounds of the y-axis on the plot.}

\item{extend}{A numeric value indicating the fraction to extend the x-axis and y-axis beyond the maximum and minimum values if \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} are not provided. For example, 0.05 will extend the x-axis and y-axis by 5 percent on each end.}

\item{xlabel}{The label to plot for the x-axis.}

\item{ylabel}{The label to plot for the y-axis.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{colorTitle}{The label to use for the legend corresponding to \code{color}.}

\item{baseSize}{The base font size (in points) to use in the plot.}

\item{ratioYX}{The aspect ratio of the x and y axes on the plot.}

\item{FUN}{The function to use for summarizing data into hexagons. Typically "mean" or something similar.}

\item{quantCut}{If this is not null, a quantile cut is performed to threshold the top and bottom of the distribution. This prevents skewed color scales caused by strong outliers. The format of this should be c(a,b) where a is the upper threshold and b is the lower threshold. For example, quantileCut = c(0.025,0.975) will take the top and bottom 2.5 percent of values and set them to the value of the 97.5th and 2.5th percentile values respectively.}

\item{addPoints}{A boolean value indicating whether individual points should be shown on the hexplot.}

\item{...}{Additional params for plotting}
}
