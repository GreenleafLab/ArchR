\arguments{
\item{ArchRProj}{An \code{ArchRProject} object.}

\item{groupBy}{The name of the column in \code{cellColData} to use for grouping multiple cells together prior to generation of the insertion coverage file.}

\item{useLabels}{A boolean value indicating whether to use sample labels to create sample-aware subgroupings during as pseudo-bulk replicate generation.}

\item{minCells}{The minimum number of cells required in a given cell group to permit insertion coverage file generation.}

\item{maxCells}{The maximum number of cells to use during insertion coverage file generation.}

\item{maxFragments}{The maximum number of fragments per cell group to use in insertion coverage file generation. This prevents the generation
of excessively large files which would negatively impact memory requirements.}

\item{minReplicates}{The minimum number of pseudo-bulk replicates to be generated.}

\item{maxReplicates}{The maximum number of pseudo-bulk replicates to be generated.}

\item{sampleRatio}{The fraction of the total cells that can be sampled to generate any given pseudo-bulk replicate.}

\item{kmerLength}{The length of the k-mer used for estimating Tn5 bias.}

\item{threads}{The number of threads to be used for parallel computing.}

\item{returnGroups}{A boolean value that indicates whether to return sample-guided cell-groupings without creating coverages.
This is used mainly in \code{addReproduciblePeakSet()} when MACS2 is not being used to call peaks but rather peaks are called from a
TileMatrix (\code{peakMethod = "Tiles"}).}

\item{parallelParam}{A list of parameters to be passed for biocparallel/batchtools parallel computing.}

\item{force}{A boolean value that indicates whether or not to overwrite the relevant data in the \code{ArchRProject} object if
insertion coverage / pseudo-bulk replicate information already exists.}

\item{verboseHeader}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose sections.}

\item{verboseAll}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose subsections.}
}
\description{
This function will merge cells within each designated cell group for the generation of pseudo-bulk replicates and then
merge these replicates into a single insertion coverage file.
