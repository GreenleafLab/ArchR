\item{ArchRProj}{An \code{ArchRProject} object}

\item{filterList}{A list of filters based on cellColData to apply when filtering cells.
Format should be a named list where the name corresponds to a column name in cellColData and the value corresponds to the filter criteria.
If numeric, a lower threshold is expected, below which cells are filtered (a higher threshold is optional).
If a chatacter vector, rows in cellColData corresponding to the supplied character values are kept.
If a list or simpleList, the user can additionally supply filters that are specific to each sample
(i.e. apply to all samples : list("TSSEnrichment" = c(4,25)),
apply to specific samples : list(TSSEnrichment = list("Sample1" = c(4, 25), "Sample2" = c(5, 25)))).}

\item{...}{additional params}
