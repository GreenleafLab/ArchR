}
\arguments{
\item{input}{An ArchRProject object or a set of ArrowFiles.}

\item{useMatrix}{The name of the matrix to be used for performing doublet identification analyses.}

\item{k}{The number of cells neighboring a simulated doublet to be considered as putative doublets.}

\item{nTrials}{The number of trials (in terms of the number of input cells) to simulate doublets when calculating doublet scores. A value of 5 would utilize 5N trials.}

\item{knnMethod}{The name of the dimensionality reduction method to be used for k-nearest neighbors calculation. Possible values are "UMAP" or "SVD".}

\item{UMAPParams}{The list of parameters to pass to the UMAP function. See the function umap in the uwot package.}

\item{LSIParams}{The list of parameters to pass to the IterativeLSI. See IterativeLSI.}

\item{outDir}{The name or path for the output directory for writing information on doublet identification,}

\item{threads}{The number threads to be used for parallel computing.}

\item{parallelParam}{QQQ A list of parameters to be used for batch-style parallel computing.}

\item{verboseHeader}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose sections.}

\item{verboseAll}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose subsections.}

\item{...}{additional args}

\item{useClusters}{QQQ A boolean value that determins QQQ}

\description{
For each sample in the Arrow files or ArchRProject provided, this function will independently assign inferred doublet information
to each cell. This allows for removing strong heterotypic doublet-based clusters downstream. A doublet results from a droplet that
contained two cells, causing the ATAC-seq data to be a mixture of the signal from each cell.
