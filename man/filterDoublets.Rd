\title{Filter Doublets From an ArchRProject}
\usage{
filterDoublets(ArchRProj, cutEnrich = 1, cutScore = -Inf,
  filterRatio = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ArchRProj}{An \code{ArchRProject} object}

\item{cutEnrich}{The minimum numeric cutoff for \code{DoubletEnrichment}. This number is equivalent to the number of simulated doublets identified as a nearest neighbor to the cell divided by the expected number given a random uniform distribution.}

\item{cutScore}{The minimum numeric cutoff for \code{DoubletScore} which represents the -log10(binomial adjusted p-value) for the \code{DoubletEnrichment}.}

\item{filterRatio}{JJJ The maximum ratio of predicted doublets to filter based on the number of pass-filter cells. If there are 10,000 cells the maximum would be filterRatio * 10,000^2 / (100,000).}
