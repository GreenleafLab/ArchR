\arguments{
\item{seTrajectory}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object that results from calling \code{getTrajectory()}.}

\item{varCutOff}{The "Variance Quantile Cutoff" to be used for identifying the top variable features across the given trajectory.
Only features with a variance above the provided quantile will be retained.}

\item{maxFeatures}{The maximum number of features, ordered by variance, to consider from \code{useMatrix} when generating a trajectory.
This prevents smoothing a large number number of features which can be very time consuming.}

\item{scaleRows}{A boolean value that indicates whether row-wise z-scores should be computed on the matrix provided by \code{seTrajectory}.}

\item{limits}{A numeric vector of two numbers that represent the lower and upper limits of the heatmap color scheme.}

\item{grepExclude}{A character vector or string that indicates the \code{rownames} or a specific pattern that identifies
rownames from \code{seTrajectory} to be excluded from the heatmap.}

\item{pal}{A custom continuous palette (see \code{paletteContinuous()}) used to override the default continuous palette for the heatmap.}

\item{labelMarkers}{A character vector listing the \code{rownames} of \code{seTrajectory} that should be labeled on the side of the heatmap.}

\item{labelTop}{A number indicating how many of the top N features, based on variance, in \code{seTrajectory} should be labeled on the side of the heatmap.}

\item{labelRows}{A boolean value that indicates whether all rows should be labeled on the side of the heatmap.}

\item{rowOrder}{If wanting to set the order of rows to be plotted, the indices (integer or character correpsonding
to rownmaes) can be provided here.}

\item{useSeqnames}{A character vector that indicates which \code{seqnames} should be plotted in the heatmap. Features from
\code{seqnames} that are not listed will be ignored. In the context of a \code{Sparse.Assays.Matrix}, such as a matrix containing chromVAR
deviations, the \code{seqnames} do not correspond to chromosomes, rather they correspond to the sub-portions of the matrix, for example
raw deviations ("deviations") or deviation z-scores ("z") for a chromVAR deviations matrix.}

\item{returnMatrix}{A boolean value that indicates whether the final heatmap matrix should be returned in lieu of plotting the actual heatmap.}

\item{force}{If useSeqnames is longer than 1 if matrixClass is "Sparse.Assays.Matrix" to continue. This is not recommended because these matrices
can be in different units.}

\item{logFile}{The path to a file to be used for logging ArchR output.}
