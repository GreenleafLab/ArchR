\title{A ggplot-based one-to-one dot plot wrapper function}
\usage{
ggOneToOne(x = NULL, y = NULL, size = 2, alpha = 1, xlabel = "x",
  ylabel = "y", title = "Correlation", min = 0.05, max = 0.9999,
  nPlot = 100 * 10^3, nKernel = 100, densityMax = 0.95,
  extend = 0.05, baseSize = 6, rastr = TRUE,
  pal = paletteContinuous(set = "blueYellow"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the x-axis values for each point.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector containing the y-axis values for each point.}

\item{size}{The numeric size of the points to plot.}

\item{alpha}{A number indicating the transparency to use for each point. See \code{ggplot2} for more details.}

\item{xlabel}{The label to plot for the x-axis.}

\item{ylabel}{The label to plot for the y-axis.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{min}{The lower limit of the x and y axes as a numeric quantile between 0 and 1.}

\item{max}{The upper limit of the x and y axes as a numeric quantile between 0 and 1.}

\item{nPlot}{The number of points to plot. When this value is less than the total points, the \code{sample} function is used to extract random data points to be plotted.}

\item{nKernel}{The number of grid points in each direction to use when computing the kernel with \code{MASS::kde2d()}.}

\item{densityMax}{The quantile that should be represented by the maximum color on the continuous scale designated by \code{pal}. Values above \code{densityMax} will be thresholded to the maximum color on the color scale.}

\item{extend}{A numeric value indicating the fraction to extend the x-axis and y-axis beyond the maximum value on either axis. For example, 0.05 will extend the x-axis and y-axis by 5 percent on each end beyond \code{quantile(c(x,y), max)} and \code{quantile(c(x,y), min)}.}

\item{baseSize}{The base font size (in points) to use in the plot.}

\item{rastr}{A boolean value that indicates whether the plot should be rasterized. This does not rasterize lines and labels, just the internal portions of the plot.}

\item{pal}{A custom palette from \code{ArchRPalettes} used to display the density of points on the plot.}

\item{...}{Additional params to be supplied to ggPoint}
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around ggplot geom_point to allow for plotting one-to-one sample comparisons in ArchR.
