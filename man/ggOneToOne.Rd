\title{A ggplot-based one-to-one dot plot wrapper function}
\usage{
ggOneToOne(x = NULL, y = NULL, size = 2, alpha = 1, xlabel = "x",
  ylabel = "y", title = "Correlation", min = 0.05, max = 0.9999,
  nPlot = 100 * 10^3, nKernel = 100, densityMax = 0.95,
  extend = 0.05, baseSize = 6, rastr = TRUE,
  pal = paletteContinuous(set = "blue_yellow"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the x-axis values for each point.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector containing the y-axis values for each point.}

\item{size}{The numeric size of the points to plot.}

\item{alpha}{A number indicating the transparency to use for each point. See \code{ggplot2} for more details.}

\item{xlabel}{The label to plot for the x-axis.}

\item{ylabel}{The label to plot for the y-axis.}

\item{title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{min}{x-limits min quantile \link{0,1}}

\item{max}{x-limits max quantile \link{0,1}}

\item{nPlot}{The number of points to plot. When this value is less than the total points, sample is used to extract random data points to plot.}

\item{nKernel}{The value of n to use the kde2d from the MASS package.}

\item{densityMax}{The quantile that should be represented by the maximum color on the continuous scale designated by \code{pal}. Above this value will be thresholded to the maximum color.}

\item{extend}{A numeric value indicating the fraction to extend the x-axis and y-axis beyond the maximum and minimum values if \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} are not provided. For example, 0.05 will extend the x-axis and y-axis by 5% on each end.}

\item{baseSize}{The base font size to use in the plot.}

\item{rastr}{A boolean value that indicates whether the plot should be rasterized. This does not rasterize lines and labels, just the internal portions of the plot.}

\item{pal}{A custom palette used to override continuousSet for coloring vector.}

\item{...}{Additional params to be supplied to ggPoint}

\description{
This function is a wrapper around ggplot geom_point to allow for plotting one-to-one sample comparisons in ArchR.
