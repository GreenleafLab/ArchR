\title{Get a data matrix stored in an ArrowFile}
\usage{
getMatrixFromArrow(ArrowFile = NULL, useMatrix = "GeneScoreMatrix",
  useSeqnames = NULL, cellNames = NULL, ArchRProj = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE, binarize = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ArrowFile}{The ArrowFile object from which the selected data matrix should be obtained.}

\item{useMatrix}{QQQ The name of the data matrix to retrieve from the given ArrowFile. Options include "TileMatrix", "GeneScoreMatrix", QQQ.}

\item{useSeqnames}{A character vector of chromosome names to be used to subset the data matrix being obtained.}

\item{cellNames}{QQQ}

\item{ArchRProj}{QQQ An ArchRProject object to be QQQ.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean value indicating whether to use verbose output during execution of  this function. Can be set to FALSE for a cleaner output.}

\item{binarize}{A boolean value indicating whether the matrix should be binarized before return. This is often desired when working with insertion counts.}

\item{...}{additional params}
}
\description{
This function gets a given data matrix from an individual ArrowFile.
