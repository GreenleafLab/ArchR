\arguments{
\item{ArchRProj}{An \code{ArchRProject} object.}

\item{useMatrix}{A character describing which matrix to use for Gene Scores for RNA integration.}

\item{matrixName}{A character describing the output matrix name for scRNA integration.}

\item{reducedDims}{The name of the \code{reducedDims} object (i.e. "IterativeLSI") to retrieve from the designated \code{ArchRProject}.
This \code{reducedDims} will be used in weighting the transfer of data to scRNA to scATAC. See \code{Seurat::TransferData} for more info.}

\item{seRNA}{A scRNA-seq \code{SummarizedExperiment} or \code{SeuratObject} to integrated with the scATAC-seq data.}

\item{groupATAC}{A column in \code{cellColData} that can be used for subgroupings in \code{groupList}. This is useful for constraining integrations.}

\item{groupRNA}{The column name in either \code{colData} or \code{metadata} of seRNA to use to compute prediction scores. These scores represent the assignment accuracy
of the group in the RNA cells. Lower scores represent ambiguous predictions and higher scores represent precise predictions.}

\item{groupList}{A list of ATAC and RNA groupings to be used for RNA ATAC integration. This is useful for constraining integrations.}

\item{sampleCellsATAC}{An integer describing the number of scATAC cells to be used for integration.
This number will be evenly divided across the total number of cells in the ArchRProject.
For example if 99,000 cells are present with a 10,000 sampleCellsATAC the number of cells used would be
closer to 9,900 to make sure subgroupings are close the the same number of cells.}

\item{sampleCellsRNA}{An integer describing the number of scRNA cells to be used for integration.}

\item{embeddingATAC}{A data.frame of cell embeddings such as a UMAP for scATAC cells to be used for density sampling.}

\item{embeddingRNA}{A data.frame of cell embeddings such as a UMAP for scRNA cells to be used for density sampling.}

\item{nGenes}{The number of variable genes determined by \code{Seurat::FindVariableGenes()} to use for integration.}

\item{useImputation}{A boolean value indicating whether to use imputation for creating the Gene Score Matrix prior to integration.}

\item{reduction}{The Seurat reduction method to use for integrating modalities. See \code{Seurat::FindTransferAnchors()} for possible reduction methods.}

\item{addToArrow}{A boolean value indicating whether to add the log2-normalized transcript counts from the integrated matched RNA to the ArrowFiles.}

\item{scaleTo}{Each column in the integrated RNA matrix will be normalized to a column sum designated by \code{scaleTo} prior to adding to ArrowFiles.}

\item{nameCell}{A column name to add the predicted scRNA cell to in the ArchRProject. This is useful for identifying which cell was closest to the scATAC cell.}

\item{nameGroup}{A column name to add the predicted scRNA group to in the ArchRProject. See \code{groupRNA} for more details.}

\item{nameScore}{A column name to add the predicted scRNA score to in the ArchRProject. This value represents the accuracy of assignment based on the
'purity' of cell assignment to a group in seRNA.}

\item{transferParams}{Additional params to be added to \code{Seurat::TransferData}.}

\item{threads}{The number of threads to be used for parallel computing.}

\item{verboseHeader}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose sections.}

\item{verboseAll}{A boolean value that determines whether standard output includes verbose subsections.}

\item{force}{A boolean value indicating whether to force the matrix indicated by \code{matrixName} to be overwritten if it already exists in the given \code{input}.}

\item{...}{Additional params to be added to \code{Seurat::FindTransferAnchors}}
}
\description{
This function, will integrate multiple subsets of scATAC cells with a scRNA experiment, compute matched scRNA profiles and
then store this in each samples ArrowFile.
