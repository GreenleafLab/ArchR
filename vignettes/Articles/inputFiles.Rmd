title: "ArchR Input Files"
---

ArchR accepts the following file types as input for `ArrowFile` creation: (i) fragment files, (ii) BAM files, and (iii) tabix __QQQ__ files. The prefered file format for the fastest processing is the fragment file which is also one of the standard 10x Genomics output files.


### Fragment Files
A fragment file is generated from aligned reads and no longer contains any primary sequence information. It is a tab-delimited text file formatted as:
```
chromosome		start		end			single-cell_barcode
chr1			1895645		1895646		AGTCGGACCTGTCAGC
```

To create a fragment file from a BAM file, __JEFF INSERT__.

### BAM Files

Aligned BAM files can be used as input directly to the `createArrowFile()`. ArchR then takes these BAM files and __QQQ__.

### Tabix files

__JEFF - I have no idea what to write for these__


__What about dealing with barcode multiplets? should that be in here?__
