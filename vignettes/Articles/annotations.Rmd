title: "Gene and Genome Annotations"
---

ArchR makes frequent use of genome and gene annotations to perform various analytical tasks. These include calculating [TSS enrichment scores](articles/Articles/qcFilters.html), annotating peak regions, and [plotting signal tracks](articles/Articles/signalTracks.html).

Gene and genome annotations are stored as part of each `ArrowFile` and each `ArchRProject`. It may seem counterintuitive to store the information in both places but this is done for ease of access because an `ArrowFile` is a large-format file in hdf5 format while and `ArchRProject` is a small compressed file that can be easily stored in memory and readily accessed.

Gene annotations are in the format __QQQ__.

Genome annotations are in the format __QQQ__.

These formats provide the flexibility for users to use whatever genome or annotation they want. To retreive annotations for your genome of interest, __QQQ__.
