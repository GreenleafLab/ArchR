ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data. Its strength is speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in QQQ hours on a macbook pro laptop. It provides facile tools to do just about anything you would want to do with single-cell ATAC-seq data. For a more detailed description of the software, please see the [publication](https://greenleaf.stanford.edu/assets/pdf/) ([pdf](http://greenleaf.stanford.edu/assets/pdf/), [supplement](http://greenleaf.stanford.edu/assets/pdf/)) or the [vignettes](articles/index.html).

# Installation of ArchR

ArchR installation currently requires devtools. The following commands will use the Bioconductor BiocManager to install required dependences:

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")

devtools::install_github("GreenleafLab/ArchR",
	auth_token = token, #Need a token to download (see personalized access tokens)
	repos = BiocManager::repositories()
)
```

### Additional packages that are used from github
To complete installation, you also must maually install the following packages using these devtools commands:

```{r}
# ggrastr is a package for plotting ggplots with rastr'd points which is super helpful for large UMAPs etc
# # You need to have Cairo installed for ggrastr to work
# # On Mac OSx you need to have XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/)
devtools::install_github('VPetukhov/ggrastr')

# harmony is a package that can correct batch effects
devtools::install_github("immunogenomics/harmony")

# presto is a package that has efficient tools for wilcoxon tests on sparseMatrices
devtools::install_github('immunogenomics/presto')
```
