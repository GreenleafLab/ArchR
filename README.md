### ArchR is currently in Beta and will be in active development through the peer review process.

ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data. ArchR provides the most extensive suite of scATAC-seq analysis tools of any software available. Additionally, ArchR excels in both speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in 8 hours on a MacBook Pro laptop.
