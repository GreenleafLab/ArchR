### ArchR is currently in Beta and will be in active development through the peer review process.

ArchR is a full-featured R package for processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data. ArchR provides the most extensive suite of scATAC-seq analysis tools of any software available. Additionally, ArchR excels in both speed and resource usage, making it possible to analyze 1 million cells in 8 hours on a MacBook Pro laptop.

# Quick Installation of ArchR
For a full walk through of installation and frequently related issues please visit www.ArchRProject.com.

**First, install devtools (for installing GitHub packages) if it isn't already installed:**
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
```

**Then, install BiocManager (for installing bioconductor packages) if it isn't already installed:**
```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
```

**Then, install ArchR:**
```{r}
devtools::install_github("GreenleafLab/ArchR", ref="master", repos = BiocManager::repositories())
```

**Lastly, install all of the ArchR dependencies that aren't installed by default:**
```{r}
library(ArchR)
ArchR::installExtraPackages()
```
If any of these steps fails, you should identify the offending package and troubleshoot that individual installation before proceeding. Additionally, please see the ArchR website (www.ArchRProject.com) where we have installation troubleshooting tips.
